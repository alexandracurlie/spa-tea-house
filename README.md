# Hey there!
Thanks for your interest, let me explain what's going on here.
This project was created a few years ago, when I just started to learn React. 
Looking back, I decided to leave this project as it is with all mistakes (and big shame in my heart) and started to refactor it, upgrade and optimise. Self code review and mentoring, in short.

So if you notice some problem in code don't be scared, its already in my Todo list.
Anyway, I appreciate all opinions whatever bad it sounds, so feel free.
